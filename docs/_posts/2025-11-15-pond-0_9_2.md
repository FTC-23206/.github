Hi everyone!

We’re thrilled to share the latest update to our Pond library — version 0.9.2, now fully aligned with our team’s codebase for the 2024–2025 FTC DECODE season. This update focuses on stability, better command-based workflows, expanded math utilities, and improved integration points for teams building complex autonomous and teleop systems.

Just like before, Pond remains independent of the FTC SDK, giving teams a clean, modular foundation that plays well with common libraries such as FTC Dashboard and RoadRunner — without update conflicts.

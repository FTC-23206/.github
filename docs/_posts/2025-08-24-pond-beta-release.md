Hi everyone, we’re incredibly excited to announce a project we’ve been working on!

For the past few months we have been working on creating and documenting our Pond library. We decided to create this library to help teams have a starting line when coding their robot, this includes clear modular organization within the code, logging capabilities, and compatibility with commonly used libraries (FTC Dashboard, RoadRunner, etc). Pond is also *independent*of the FTC SDK, to ensure no difficulties in updates to either causing conflicts with the other. Please check out our documentation here: [Welcome to the Pond!](/pond) 

Today, we are releasing a *beta version*, this version is still undergoing changes and tests, but, what we truly need, is feedback from all of you. Whether you are a veteran, a rookie, or an alum we would appreciate you leaving your feedback and suggestions [here](/pond/feedback). We want this to be a helpful and accessible resource to all!

Thank you, Automaducks

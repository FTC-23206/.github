## Who we are!

We are the Automaducks, Team 23206, a rookie team getting ready to compete in the CENTERSTAGE challenge. What sets us apart from other teams is that we are a small, all-girl team: Maya Bomfim, Jiayi Xiong, Anzelia Yu, and Prisha Kulkarni. Since there are four of us, everyone has to do a little of everything. Whether it be coding, building, or outreach, all of us work together to complete tasks. All of us are 8th graders who attend Beaver Lake Middle school, in the state of Washington, where we initially got introduced to robotics and the FIRST programs over the past few years.

## Robot Orientation

### Definition
Robot-centered orientation is where the movement of the robot is based on the robotâ€™s own perspective. For instance, if the joystick is pushed forward, the robot moves forward based on its front no matter how it's oriented.

## Units

| Measurement | Unit    | Comment                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Distance    | (Any)   | Be consistent across code                                                                   |
| Angle       | Radians | Unless otherwise denoted                                                                    |
| Time        | Seconds | When possible, use the Duration class to correctly represent time with nanosecond precision |

> Per above, if distance is used in Inches, Speed will be represented in Inches/Second.

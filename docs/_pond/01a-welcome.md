## What is Pond

## Functionality

These are few of benefits of using Pond library:

* abcd

## Library Dependencies

Pond is a stand alone library which does not have any additional dependency other than the Java Android SDK. It doesn't even depend on the FTC SDK, which means you don't have to worry about upgrading the Pond library when FIRST releases a new FTC SDK (although you still have to upgrade your your robot code!).

> **Note:** Pond is a stand alone library that does not require you to use any other additional FTC library, unless you choose to do so!

But that doesn't mean Pod doesn't work well with other libraries, in fact it is built with the aim to take full advantage of common FTC Libraries:

* [FTC Dashboard](https://acmerobotics.github.io/ftc-dashboard/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

## What is Pond

Pond is a Java library made for FTC Teams of all levels. Much of the code is inspired by FRC [WPILib]{:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and FTC [FTCLib]{:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} but there are also different approaches and functionality based on our learnings over the years.

Here are the main benefits of the library:

1. Performant programming through non-blocking *event driven* commands
2. Modular hardware control through *subsystems*
3. Works seamlessly with other popular libraries such as [Road Runner]{:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [FTC Dashboard]{:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} without depending on them.
4. It does not depend on the FTC SDK, thus allowing teams to have full control on FTC SDK version upgrade.

> **Beginner** teams can write advanced robot code by following the examples and using out-of-the-box library functionality while **veteran** teams can extend library functionality and also decide with specific features to use, based on the team needs.

## Installation Methods

There are 2 available installation methods:

* **Quick Start**: zero-code process that gets you started from a new FTC Repo which is ready to run. This is recommended for beginner to intermediate teams which are not looking into bringing their existing code *as-is* to the new repository.

* **Project Update**: adding Pond library reference to your existing code. This is recommended for advanced teams who wants to be selective about how to integrate and which functionality to depend on.

> **Tip:** The 2 installation methods allow you to reach the same result as the Pond library is always used as a library reference. The only difference is the path to get there. In other words, no matter which way you chose to start, both methods allow for the same result in the end.
